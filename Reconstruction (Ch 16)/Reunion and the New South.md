- Who gained and who suffered from north v south?
	- (i wonder) union back together at cost of lower-class whites and African Americans
	- "New South" hailed by rich northerners, actually poor and exploited by northern buissness intrists, (probably continues this way into the great depression, (read grapes of wrath))
## Compromise of 1877
- Rutherford Hayes (Republican govenor, didn't care about grant corruption)
- vs Samuel Tilden (dem reformer, fighting corruption of grant)
- Super close, contested election undecided for months 
	- Congress appoints 15 person committee to determine votes of 3 disbuted states
	- (7+7+1 but the independant quits adn it becomes 7v8 (D/R) and  they vote on party lines)
		- Republicans decide that the disputed goes should go to Hayes AND The compromise of 1877
- We don't know exactly what the compromise said, but Hayes then told the southern governments still under military control from grant to allow being taken over, and withdrew troops from south
- Last Radical govs fell, no chance for 2 party competition for white southerners (they really didn't like the forced republican military gov, so they were all dems)
## "Redeeming" a New South
- Redeemers
	- Coalition of ppl who took over south state governments (redeeming them)
	- Previous planters, commertialist / industrialists, and politicians
	- Laissez-faire and white supremacy 
		- said opponents trying to return to "black domination" or divide the white party
- hospitable to incoming industry, including northern rail people
- cut budgets to schooling, also still had bribery / embezzlement and neglected small white farmers like previous governments
- Farmers in super deep debt to creditors
- realized no gov regulation better then state subsidies (Laissez-faire) free trade
- Crop Liens: "Security agreement that uses a growing crop as **collateral** for a **loan** of money or goods."
- Protests break out when cotton prices fall 
	- Southern Farmers Alliance or the Populist Party 
## Rise of Jim Crow
- Thomas "Daddy" Rice did blackface and sang "Jump Jim Crow", now black ppl = jim crow
- New redeemers and dem govs passed jim crow laws, african american violince continued
- Started as informal segregation (seperate traincars), became legally binding
- Redeemers "said" they would respect 14th and 15 amendment
	- Black voters that voted republican were visited at night and whipped, might lose job
	- Dems threw away unwanted votes, controlled machines
	- Literacy tests added
- Still some blacks voted freely, some even elected congress ppl, (Robert Smalls district)
	- George H. White
