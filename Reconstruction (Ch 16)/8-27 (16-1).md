Reconstruction
- good ideas, bad implimentation, failed partly cause money???
- Readmission of 11 states
- south destroyed completly
- Wasn't
	- equal
	- a solution
	- actually good
- "Conquered Nation" status: (giving legal status to south so the north can control)
	- Whoever got conquered looked over by america / conquerer
	- Allows to supress rights and couldn't self determine
	- south conquered by north, USA shattered
- Robert E Lee, south commander traitor?
- Abe Lincoln
	- didn't want war or to further punish the south (not kick them when they down)
	- Wanted to help the south, not controll it
	- Freedom for all -> wrote 13th amendment -> republican moderate -> constitution works (guide)
- 10% plan
	- 10% of white males ppl swear oath to
	- New state constitutions (No slavery)
	- Super ez for the south (ppl argued this is bad)
- Restoration plan
	- 20% white property owning ppl take oath, and new madatory state constitution
- Wade/Davis Bill (Actual bill)
	- 50% ppl take oath
	- Says the South needs to pay for reconstruction
	- Lincoln **vetoed** it (wanted his plan, quick simple friendly) -> ppl angy
- Moderates - (lincoln / johnson) smooth transition
- Radicles, (house republicans) make the south pay (angry when lincoln vetoed) 
	- Fundamental angy w/ lincoln, wanted to control reconstruction
		- They get to control the money 
	- (Thaddeus Stevens) Own 13th amendment, wanted to end slavery, dissagreed (w/ lincoln) how to reconstruct 
	- Confederates should be punished, small / strict gov, freed slaves same rights
	- **South should be accountable, north should monitor it  **

- What do we do next???
	- Rebuild Infra, help economy, provide for slaves to help them get going (they had nothing)
		- Healthcare, education, training

- Why did it fail???
	- Looked great ok paper, and in theory BUT... Corruption and fruad, underfunding, badly implimented

- Radicales don't like lincoln so much they higher:
- **john wilkes booth:** (money involved)
	- "handsomest man in america", actor, made 600k a year (in today money)
	- Brother was most famous actor of all time, saved Lincoln's son's life
		- Brother is how john got access to prez
- Why??? (and the bigger plan)
	- **MONEY!!!! and power**
	- Apart of larger plan to unravel us government so that the radicales could "save" the country and get power
	- Lewis Powell, tried to assassinat secretary of state, w/ booth at gettysburg
	- David Herold, Backed out of assassinating the prez
	- Stupides guy on the planet: George Atzerot, couldn't be a lookout or see police
		- Got hung super fast, government wants to end this movement
	- Mary Surratt, South sympathizer living in north, helped booth, owned hotel handed booth cash / horses to get away
		- Convicted to a military tribunal (no majority needed
	- Dr. Mudd, Guilty by association but pardoned by Johnson, had house planned to kidnap prez
		- why? tobacco buisness gone as civil war, angy w/ gov

Facts:
- Lincoln was a obstacle to republicans
Conjecture???:
- Alot of money involved, booth never acceped results of civil war
- Wrong power in gov

How we move forward:
- Johnson into office, radicals tell him what to do, "puppet president"
- He goes diff direction from radical republicans, followed Abe Lincoln
- Radicles don't like this new direction either, try to impeach him
