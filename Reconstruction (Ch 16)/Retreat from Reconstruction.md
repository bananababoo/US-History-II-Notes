- Ulysses S. Grant elected -> inconsistant policy + corruption
	- Not really good prezident, good military guy tho
	- Other stuff got more important and the south was kinda forgotten about (whoo no slavery)
## Final Efforts for Reconstruction
- Fifteenth Amendment: can't restrict voting based on race or condition as slave
	- Still allowed for sneaky stuff like literacy tests, poll taxes or property ownership
- Women still upset they can't vote: Susan B Anthony / Elizabeth Stanton
	- Other feminist's say that negros have had it worse and its good that they can vote, (no rebell needed)
- Grant needs to enforce it cause republican power in south relied on black vote,
	- even thought people stopped caring, thats how this got passed
## KKK Time
- Get the south back to former glory ( stop reconstruction, get rid of black ppl power)
- Based on grassroots support and stuff, so decentralized and hard to supress
- "Night riders" came to black republicans houses, threatened or hurt them
		- Caused grant to lose in Lousiana (Knights of White Camellia
		- More insurrections caused more dems to come to power
- caused Force Acts (KKK Acts) interfearence w/ voting now a crime
	- Federal supervision of elections
	- Worked fairly good actually, altho not may kkk people prosecuted

- Now that blacks can vote, dems need to change stratagy -> openly white supremacisty + gov promotion of economic development -> dems got support of **white republicans** (origionally one coalition of Southern Republican Party)
	- No masks, openly white suprimicest
		- Worked cause north realizes while republican regimes in south have good causes, they are increasingly corrupt and failing.
- White League kinda stopped for last time during insurrectoion taking back "stolen" election
- In mississippi after Grant dosn't send troops to stop white militia black ppl spooked
- Stopped voting and missippi fell to dems
- Reconstruction stoped when:
	- Grant was hesitent and inconsistant
	- North not tolerating gove propping up military action to sustain republican south / black voting rights. (we are fighting ourself again)
