## Effects
Early Industry In South Reconstruction:
- Lumber Industry, all buildings need lumber
- New saw mills, more housing = pop growth
New Political System: **Redeemers**
- want new schools, work for certain group of people, want to go back go old south

How the south Failed:
- Rural territory, mainly cotton based industry
- Property foreclosures
- No economic diversity, reconstruction didn't work, gov didn't help

Getting back to work:
- Crop-Lien System: work for someone on their land, (workers can go home), 
	- Workers use collateral to go into debt and pay back 
	- Small Plantations
- Sharecropping: Tied people to land, mostly ex-slaves, 
	- got way more debt then poor southerners
	- Big Plantations
	- Owned by the plantation store
	- Debt was transferrable, if you died kids got it
Cash Crop: cotton and stuff
Race relations: 
- Gap forming between rich and poor, and widening
- Stress of failing cause now you are "lower-class" and might look like economically "black"
- Mississippi plan: 
	- Take back political gains gotten by blacks / voting rights, enforce jim crow
Segregation (separate but equal(not equal))
Mob Rule: white workers attacking blacks, gang violence legal means to control citizens
- Colfax Massacre: 300 armed white dems attacked unarmed ex-slaves women / children
	- Battle over the 4
	- Cause: KKK, Knights of the White Camelia
- Intent of Jim crow:
	- Control what people can / can't do
	- Anti-Freedman's Bureau, offset there 
- KKK super intimidating, fear againsted breaking out, no safety and the feds (grant) not doing anything
	- If we keep killing blacks, the force will see it easier to go back to old way
- KKK: white supremacy, "white riders"
	- Nathan Forrest, (Confederate Soldier), deeply religious
	- Freemason
	- Judge jury executioner, feared everywhere
Carpet Baggers: Northen ppl wanting polit power over locals, investing money
	- Want to make profit, carried everything in carpet bag
	- Multi-level-marketing scheme type deal
Scalawags: Southerns that sympathetic to north (dems hated them):
- Freedmans beuaru supporters, northern southerners
- Also would steal your wallet and lie about it
Grant Leaves White House:
- Reconstruction failure, numerous scalawag

New president (Hayes), pop vote vs electoral college:
Compromise of 1877:
- Backroom dealing, hayes wins however:
	- new factories in south
	- pull out troops
	- appoint dems in cabinet, build transcontinental through the south
