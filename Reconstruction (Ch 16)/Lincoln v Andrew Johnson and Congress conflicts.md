- How far should gov go to secure freedom for former slaves?

Ten Percent Plan: (Lincoln) {to shorten the war} 
- 10% voters sign loyalty oath & state abolish slavery then:
- Pardon all southerners (except leaders) and state allowed back into the union
- congress didn't like (didn't trust confederates and didn't want them back in congress)
	- Didn't pass

Wade-Davis Bill (Congress) {counter Ten Percent Bill} 
- If you swear loyalty and to not enslave African Americans, you can vote in continental convention 
- No black suffrage, but required no slavery to be in new state constitution
- Lincoln vetoed (didn't really like the plan) and now congress pissed off (radical republics -> booth)
- Stalemate until end of war (Lincoln assassinated)
## Andrew Johnson
- Congress didn't like his policies either -> "most serious crisis in relations between executive and legislative branches of federal government"
	- He thought "every head of family in the US had one slave to take the drudgery and menial service off his family" (slavery is fine he thought)
- Was put as VP (like walz) to make more centeral election, wasn't meant to be prez, 
	- liked to punish southern traitors/prevent power gain (south poor rep)
	- bad guy but also not (cause people are complex)
- ## **13th amendment -> Prohibits slavery**
- Put democrate states previously republican govs under confederate provisional governments 
	- made sure only loyal whites could vote
	- Confed leaders and **rich people** (johnson grew up poor) had to apply for pardon to get rank / money / land back
- Confederate states put **black codes** ^09ed76
	- Restricting rights of black people (denied choice of employment)
	- Couldn't testify in court
	- Johnson kinda responsible, friedly to members of old elite
- Congress upset, blacks can't vote, white sympethizer still prez 
## Congress takes Initiative
- Johnson wanted states rights and prewar federal system (+ no slavery) but same besides that
- Republicans (congress) didn't want the southerners to regain power / influence through being mean to black people.
- They didn't nessecairly thing blacks are equal to white but that all ppl in USA are equal regardless of race **(plus the freed blacks would vote for republicans if they could)**
- Freedmen's Bureau
	- Agency to provide stuff (food water medicine) for freed men (uninslaved) 
	- Johnson vetos this and Black Codes[#^09ed76] (overridden by congress, first time in a while veto overruled)
- Johnson then makes new conservative party( few republicans + south dems)
- ## Congress, now scared a little, passes  14th amendment (Black citizenship)
	- Citizenship to ex slaves and protect equal rights to all ppl born in USA (**citizens**)
	- States need to accept (radify) it to join back
		- Johnson dosn't like 
			- Central government with all power controlling, wanted stats to make own policies
			- Told the states to not accept it (all but Tennessee listened )
	- White ppl Riots aginsted blacks made it clear that states couldn't do "life liberty property" protection of ex slaves
- Johnson does a trump. Goes around the country cussing his polit opponents out 
- republicans get 2/3rdfs majority in house and senate 

## The Reconstruction Amendments (13/14/15)
- (Ended slavery, rights of due process / equal protection, right to vote (not women tho lol) )
- Didn't really finish the "Reconstruction"
	-  Amendments not fully followed, only really carried out to protect business corporations
	- equal protection = affirmative action?
	- Due process = reproductive choice?

## Congress Reconstruction Plan Effects (Radical)
- Radical Reconstruction
	- Subvert democracy and create military districts to let black ppl not be oppressed (regeneration before reconstruction)
	- Federal authority needed to transition away from slavery
	- Redistribute land to blacks and federal aid to educate 
		- Most republicans didn't like, cause it was kinda authoritarian or monarchy like and it threw away property rights.
- First act made 5 military districts, lasted short time as new acts allowed for states to join if they ratified a new constitution allowing black voting
- Ex-Confederates stil banned from being in charge or voting  cause republicans wanted "loyals" only
- Republicans then thought that once blacks could vote then they couldn't have their rights taken away, but that didn't really work, nice try democracy tho. This skued from the radical idea that you need complete gov intervention to fix the issue (who knows if this would have worked better, maybe)
- Cool idea that ppl in charge, gave other ppl voting rights, instead of militarily telling the south to do the right stuff, big wins for democracy except that enforcing equal sufferage in the south is pretty hard

## Impeachment!!!!! AAAAA  (*you almost got me* - Big A)
- or how do we get this dumb anti equality guy out of here cause hes not letting us do what we want and make military governments in the south to force white ppl to be nice to black people and white people can't vote or do anything about it. (morally good, democratically bad)
- Johnson didn't like any of this congress stuff
	- Dismissed office ppl who liked reconstruction (radical)
	- Countermanded general orders in the south
	- Conservitives dems replaces radicals
- Congress upset -> Tenure of Office Act: Senate approval for removal of officials
- Johnson says: no you can't do that, constiotution says seperation of powers
- Congress: ill impeach you instead (politicoally)
	- Said he violated Tenure of Office Act
	- and sabatoged restoration.
	- Didn't get impeached cause some center republicans didn't want to set the precedent to impeach ppl who are restricting state freedoms.
