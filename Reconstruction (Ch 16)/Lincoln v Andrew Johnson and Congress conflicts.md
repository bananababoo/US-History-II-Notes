- How far should gov go to secure freedom for former slaves?

Ten Percent Plan: (Lincoln) {to shorten the war} 
- 10% voters sign loyalty oath & state abolish slavery then:
- Pardon all southerners (except leaders) and state allowed back into the union
- congress didn't like (didn't trust confederates and didn't want them back in congress)
	- Didn't pass

Wade-Davis Bill (Congress) {counter Ten Percent Bill} 
- If you swear loyalty and to not enslave African Americans, you can vote in continental convention 
- No black suffrage, but required no slavery to be in new state constitution
- Lincoln vetoed (didn't really like the plan) and now congress pissed off
- Stalemate until end of war (Lincoln assassinated)
## Andrew Johnson
- Congress didn't like his policies either -> "most serious crisis in relations between executive and legislative branches of federal government"
	- He thought "every head of family in the US had one slave to take the drudgery and menial service off his family" (slavery is fine he thought)
- Was put as VP (like walz) to make more centeral election, wasn't ment to be prez, 
	- Super far right??? liked to punish southern traitors/prevent power gain
	- bad guy but also not (cause people are complex)
- **13th amendment -> Prohibits slavery**
- Put confederate states under republican provisional governments 
	- made sure only loyal whites could vote
	- Confed leaders and **rich people** (johnson grew up poor) had to apply for pardon to get rank / money / land back
- Confederate states put **black codes**
	- Restricting rights of black people (denied choice of employment)
	- Couldn't tesitfy in court
	- Johnson kinda responsible, friedly to members of old elite
- Congress upset, blacks can't vote, white sympethizer still prez
