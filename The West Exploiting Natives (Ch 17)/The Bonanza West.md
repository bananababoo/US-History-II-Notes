Why was the West a bonanza of dreams and get-rich-quick schemes?

Bonanza consequences:
- uneven growth
- boom-and-bust economic cycles
- wasted resources
Instant cities: San Francisco, Denver, as people moved west
West is an idea as much as a place, 
## Mining
half of people going west weren't miners, but service workers for miners (food, clothing, services)
- Placer mining: Shovel and washing pan (little skill)
- Large corporations came in to do actual mine mining underground
	- Required large equipment, mercury vats, 
	- Labor unionized
- Comstock Lode: (nevada) big ore deposit, 306 million$ of gold/silver
- John Mackey forms mining company, dig into nevada, find 54 feet of gold, become richest man in world
- Black Hills rush 1874-1876:
	- army tried to get miners out of Sioux land, sent scientest to disprove that there was any gold
	- the scientists found a ton of gold, chaos insues
	- Deadwood (most lawless camp)
	- Calamity Jane meets "Wild Bill" Hickok (who gets shot in the head after doing Buffalo Bill's Rodeo Show)
- Farming was mostly rural, Mining lead to rapid urbanization leading to govs / law enforcement
	- Made rules about mining claims, law disputes settled or people were hanged, sometimes court / legal counsal
- Alot of Prostitutes, cause of course but other women were cooks, way less women then men
- 1/2-1/4 pop foreign
	- Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882: no new chinese immigration for 10 years
- Overall mining: lots of money, financed industrilization / civil war, more states, women aginsted alcohol, but indians destroyed and ghost towns were made

## From Gold Mining to Oil Fracking (boom and bust)
- Oil boomed cause they could make it faster, small towns in texas got rich
- Fracking and stuff
- Way more supply + global economy slowdown = prices fall
- oil not worth as much anymore, oil towns became quiet again

## Cattle Bonanza
Vaqueros (early Spanish cowboys): cattle in open range, w/ branding & roping
Hard bit was to transport beef east:
- solution: put them on a train (still alive) on the Chisholm trial
- huge profits (1000% markup)
