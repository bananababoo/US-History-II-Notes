Why was the West a bonanza of dreams and get-rich-quick schemes?

Bonanza consequences:
- uneven growth
- boom-and-bust economic cycles
- wasted resources
Instant cities: San Francisco, Denver, as people moved west
West is an idea as much as a place, 
## Mining
half of people going west weren't miners, but service workers for miners (food, clothing, services)
- Placer mining: Shovel and washing pan (little skill)
- Large corporations came in to do actual mine mining underground
	- Required large equipment, mercury vats, 
	- Labor unionized
- Comstock Lode: (nevada) big ore deposit, 306 million$ of gold/silver
- John Mackey forms mining company, dig into nevada, find 54 feet of gold, become richest man in world
- Black Hills rush 1874-1876:
	- army tried to get miners out of Sioux land, sent scientest to disprove that there was any gold
	- the scientists found a ton of gold, chaos insues
	- Deadwood (most lawless camp)
	- Calamity Jane meets "Wild Bill" Hickok (who gets shot in the head after doing Buffalo Bill's Rodeo Show)
- Farming was mostly rural, Mining lead to rapid urbanization leading to govs / law enforcement
	- Made rules about mining claims, law disputes settled or people were hanged, sometimes court / legal counsal
- Alot of Prostitutes, cause of course but other women were cooks, way less women then men
- 1/2-1/4 pop foreign
	- Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882: no new chinese immigration for 10 years
- Overall mining: lots of money, financed industrialization / civil war, more states, women aginsted alcohol, but Indians destroyed and ghost towns were made

## From Gold Mining to Oil Fracking (boom and bust)
- Oil boomed cause they could make it faster, small towns in texas got rich
- Fracking and stuff
- Way more supply + global economy slowdown = prices fall
- oil not worth as much anymore, oil towns became quiet again

## Cattle Bonanza
Vaqueros (early Spanish cowboys): cattle in open range, w/ branding & roping
Hard bit was to transport beef east:
- solution: put them on a train (still alive) on the Chisholm trial
- huge profits (1000% markup)
Cowboys: 1/4 black, 1/4 mexican, 1/2 white
- kinda above the law, so they made their own
	- shoot someone, hung on the spot
- Wyoming Stock Growers' Association: big cattle org
- Ended near 1880s after 6 mil exports
	- People were planting wheat, 
	- Barbed wire devides
	- Now just large corperations w/ expensive tech
	- Winter of 1886 (-45 temps), lots of cattle/crops died
- Eventually bounced back but smaller, more contained, 
- Days of Open Range (no fencing) was over, Homesteaders / private property pushing west

## Farming Bonanza
- Pushed out indiands, some had to to make farms to survive
- by 1900 the west had 30% of american pop (30 years ago it was 1%)
- Faming predictable, more sustainable then trying to find gold
- Blacks from south (fead up w/ murder, Crop Liens, and Black Codes)
- Known as the Exodusters
	- New freeer lives in kansas on own farm, women cleansed house or worked in field w/ men
	- Others moved to oklahome to try to make first african american state
		- Kinda worked, some towns w/ black self gov established
- Plains Problems:
	- Little water, small wells, well drillers expensive (2$ per foot which was alot on a 250$ a month salary)
	- Windmills kinda works but expensive
	- Farmers couldn't afford wood for houses made Sod Houses (2.78$)
	- Scarece glass -> cloth windows, blankets held to seperate rooms
	- Weather was harsh, lots of ice in winter 110 temp in sumer, rainstorms tht leaked in houses
	- Grass hoppers in summer ate everything
- New ides to fix these issues( Joseph F. Gildden inventor of barbed wire)

## Farm Discontent
- National Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry (Oliver H. Kelly)
	- Make farming life easier, supply coop stores, insurance, farm machaniery factories
		- Most failed but the idea people liked (Farmers Allience continued it )
	- Grew super fast (800k memebers )
	- Sevear drought cut harvests in 1887, half of west kansas leaves
	- People upset
- Mississippi = nations garden
- California: fruit, wine wheat
- Utah florished cause mormons were there
- Produced more then US could consume, started exporting
- More competition, farming more commertial / scientifitc (how to min max)
- Added Mail-Order and Free Deliviery 
## Last Rush
- Oklahoma Land Rush
	- Congress forces native Creek / Seminole tribes to surrender rights to land
	- 100k people lined the border and after a flag waved and cannon fired people ran to get land 
	- 1.9 million acers claimed in like 12 hours
- "Boomers" vs "Sooners" (jumped the gun vs waited for the time)


- Fredrick Jackson Turner
	- "The signaficance of the Frontier in American History" essay  during Worlds Columbian Exhibition 
	- frontier makes America unique
	- Thesis: 
		- frontier -> independance, individualism, confidence, American spirit
	- later on people realised that also:
		- enviromental impact, and the federal gov's impact
		- whites prob conquered, not settled west
## What actually is the West
- kicked out all the natives
