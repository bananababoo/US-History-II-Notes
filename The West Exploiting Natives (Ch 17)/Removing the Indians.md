## Plain Indian Life
- Most natives lived on plains  (comanche, apache...) in groups of 300-500
- Once the Spanish introduced horses, they spread rapidly among the natives, transitioning from farming civilizations to nomadic **buffalo** hunting culture
	- They used all parts of hunted animals, unlike whites
	- skin into tepees, blankets, bones became knives, hooves into glue, manure burned as fuel
- divided labor by gender, men hunted / traded / manly authoritative stuff
- Women did berry picking, children and artistic and prep roles, sometimes incharge of property
- Kinship descended matrilinearialy
- In other places like Sioux, little diff between gender status, bot were respected for diff jobs

## "What do we do about the Indians?" - US Gov
- Originally everything past Mississippi was Indian territory, then we found gold
- Abandoned old policy, split up land into defined boundaries per tribe
- Didn't really work, only lasted a few years
	- Natives weren't usually those who stayed within bounds, nomadic
	- White ppl pored in everywhere, asked gov to protect them
	- Indians pushed out of kansas even as white reformers fought to keep the territory for blacks
- 2 tribes asked for peace (Cheyenne and Arapaho)
	- **Chivington Massacre** Colonel Chivington and his min massacured a group who thought fighting was over
	- Chief Black Kettle (native leader) tried to surrender w/ American flag and white flag
	- Set off protests -> congress made treaty condemning own military
- Commence also ousted from land it was told it would have forever
- Gov makes trail to connect mining towns, in middle of Sioux territory
- **Fetterman Massacre**: Red cloud (Sioux chief) wants to stop it, ambushes army column and wipes out all 82 of the soldiers (Fetterman Massacre)
- Big debate on weather Indians are scary evil uncivil satanists or just ppl who don't know better or maybe don't like being moved around
	- Some churches wanna white man's burden it, civilice the people and stop the fighting
	- Many others think natives are savages unfit for civilization, wanted **firm control** (and swift punishment of rebell)
- Peace advocates won the debate kinda, (for now) Bozeman trail gets paused, only 1 perm solution
	- isolate **natives** to even smaller chunk of **reservation** land, teach them to farm and civilize them
	- Natives agreed (probably reluctantly, what else they gonna do)
## Final Battles
- (effects of reservations)
	- Changed old customs / traditions, some chiefs deined and went back to old ways
- Sioux gethered to stop prospectors going through their land for gold
	- "Custer's last stand", US guy wanted to get a head start on defense aginsted gathering natives and tried to attack small camp, but turned out it was the main camp and all of the american dudes died. When word got back it was phrased as tho the Sioux did it first, nation-wide revenge wanted aginst natives now.
- After the Sioux were later beaten and surrendered less war happened (the natives saw what would happen)
- **Ghost Dances**, dances to make dead natives come back, and unite all natives and drive away whites
	- Army tried to stop it, in the **Wounded Knee Massacre** (custers team, now with machine guns) killed everyone in a ghost dance lead by aging chief Big Foot.
## End of Tribal Life
- Tribes no longer separate nations, way less judicial or political power
- Cause ongoing civil rights movement, segregation = bad so new idea made
- **Assimilationists** or if you treat it like a white man it is a white man
- Schools opened (Carlisle Indian School / Hasklee institute) forced indans to act like white people
	- Banned tribal paint /clothes, taught to farm / use machines
- **Dawes Severalty Act**, or if Indians own land then they would become responsible self-reliant American citizens
	- Each family gets 160 acres, (natives didn't know how to farm)
	- didn't really work out, gov went back to tribal land ownership, by then land shrunk from 138 million to 47 million of Indian acres, half unoccupied.
- "Every Buffalo dead is a Indian gone". also buffalo hinds make valuable leather
	- William F "Buffalo Bill" Cody killed alot
	- Almost went extinct
- By 1900, 250k natives left, most in poverty on reservations, w/ alcoholism and unemployed
- Lost cultural distinctiveness
- Large scale non-temporary forced migration. 
- Became part of romantic folk-lore 
	- Tales of "Buffalo Bill" fighting off the indian's and making a profit
	- Made a Wild West Show w/ caricatures of Indians chacing buffalo, performing war dance.
