Westward expansion, and what you had to do to get it
- Poor easterners (north and south) told to go west and make farms, then you don't need to work in factory, and you have ez life forever as a shrimple farmer
- Raw mats sent from west to north east, on rail and cart to northern factoriesa
- West economy relies on gov subsidies (rail, army, indian reservations)
- Now instead of nothing there were alot of small towns
- "the West had become a place of conquest and exploitation, as well as a mythic land of cowboys and quick fortunes."

- The West, in this view, was not settled by a wave of white migrants moving west across the continent (Turner ’s “frontier”) but by a set of waves—Anglo, Mexican American, African American, Asian American, and others—moving in many directions and interacting with each other and with Native American cultures to produce the modern West. Nor did western history end in 1890 as Turner would have it. Instead, migration, development, and economic exploitation continued into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, illustrated by the fact that many more people moved to the West after 1900 than before.
- In the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries, there can be no doubt that the image of the frontier and the West influenced American development. Western lands attracted European, Latin American, and Asian immigrants, adding to the society’s talent and diversity. The mines, forests, and farms of the West fueled the economy, sent raw materials to eastern factories, and fed the growing cities. Though defeated in warfare, the Native Americans and Mexicans influenced art, architecture, law, and western folklore. The West was the first American empire, and it profoundly affected the American mind and imagination.
