- Challenges of settling in the west
	- Mostly environmental

- Rocky Mountains were pretty rocky, not much water / rivers
- Deserts, praries and mountains 
- Great Plains: treeless, nearly flat, endless
- Little rainfall (15 inches per year)
- Stuff they were used to (cast iron plow,  boats, and ax's) didn't really help
	- cause little to no trees
