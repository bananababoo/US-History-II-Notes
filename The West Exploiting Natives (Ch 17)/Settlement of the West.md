- Why move west?
	- Expanding need for agri, lumber, to support growing pop
	- Some wanted to escape religious persecution (mormons)
	- Some people were just bored of the city 
	- The poor and unemployed did not have money to go west, 
- Gold Rush of 1849
		- Prospectors found gold in california in 1849 (49ers), set off boom, searched and found more in nearby regions, (who sold the pickaxes?)
## On the Overland Trail
- Overland trail, route from mississippi to east coast
- "american dream" ideal: cheap / free to acquire land, and enough hard work = build homes and have success 
- caravans, 150+ wagons
- Full family came, men decided
- “Every man to carry with him a Bible and other religious books, as we hope not to degenerate into a state of barbarism,” (scary indians, but not their fault they people to, just didn't have bible)
- Everyone had diff ideas on when to stop, how fast to go etc
- 15 miles a day, stopping for breakfast and lunch
- women: lonely, some adopted new clothes, others thought short skirts indeacent
- Fair amount of trash left behind
- Trip takes 16 months, in best conditions, (16 hours a day)
## Land for the taking
- Why did people move so much?
	- Free land, if you get it its yours
- Homestead act of 1862: 
	- 160 acers for 10$ + live there and make a farm for 5 years
- 600k families claimed this deal
- Less water in the west + few people had enough money for advanced farm equipment and wait 2 years to be self sustainable
- Some people specifically bought out all the rivers, then resold for higher prices
- Others planned for like egypt style irrigation paths
- National Reclamation Act...
