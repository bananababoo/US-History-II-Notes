Why did cities in the United States grow between  1880 and 1900?

- City, new symbol for America
- 1/6th of people lived in cities, now 1/2
- NY, Chicago, Philly have 1 mil+ populations

## Skyscrapers and Suburbs
- Before, buildings could only be made so tall, made of masonry
- Steel/girders allowed buildings to go taller
- John Root rebuild chicago after that big fire (part 2)
	- Noticed fire happened cause of fancy decorations on outside of buildings -> plain stripped down boring style (modernist)
	- Office tower more then church or gov symbolized society
	- simplicity, stability, dignity
	- Wainwright building
- Louis Sullivan: 
	- We need to fit as many people in a space as possible, invets skyscrapers
	- about the moment cities stopped being walkable, (cars woo (probably lobbied))
- Mass transit systems (cable cars) Home -> CBD (central business district)
	- Widely separate residential and business
- **Middle class leaves the city -> immigrants / working class moves in**
	- Poor / working people closer to city / work, more wealthy people had car / lived in suburbs
- Previously, all classes / occupations thrown together
- Because of StreetCar cities, (+ more transit), society fragmented
- Middle class residential rings, business working class core (human geo stuff, remember?)
