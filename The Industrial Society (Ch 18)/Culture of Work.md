How did wage earners organize in this period, and what demands did they make?

- People coming from farms not used to factory life
	- market, not seasons, indoors, time based on clock not the sun
- People moved around alot, 1/2 of people in one census wern't in same place in the next
- Andrew Carnegie (Steel guy) rags to riches story
	- Not many actually did rags to riches, but people looked up to it
- Workers had hope, 1/4 moved up to middle class
## Labor Unions
- Previously, labor unions didn't have much power, only had 2-10% support of people. Workers thought unions were "foreign" / radical.
- The more nationally connected / unified / monopolized the economy -> more unions
- Knights of Labor
	- Terrance V Powderly Eventually started to recruite everyone possible, women, africans, everyone
	- Producers (Workers, employers) vs non-Producers (bankers, lawyers, gamblers)
	- 8 hour day, no child labor. Utopian dreams
	- Powderly didn't like strikes, but they happened anyway
		- Strike against Gould (Missouri Pacific Railroad)
			- Eventually crushed -> lots of people left the union (didn't wanna be fired)
	- Lead to the
- American Federation of Labor (AFL), union alliance
	- worked for specific practical objectives, no politics 
	- President Samuel Gompers
		- Messed w/ socialist policies, but was OK w/ capitalism and wanted to work w/ it
		- Wanted more rewarding place for laborers in the system
	- AFL assumed people would stay workers their entire lives, not magically be rich
	- Wanted to make labor lives practice, good wages / conditions
	- If treated fairly, AFL gives stable work force, wouldn't even oppose monopolies/trusts if fair wage given -> got 1/3 of country's workers on board
	- Ignored women tho (Cigar Makers Union / Typographical Union accepted women, that's it)
	- Discouraged black membership, "restricting membership allows union to succeed"
## Labor Unrest
- Workers set tone of speed / quality of work, friends taught immigrants how to deal w/ work
- Fraternal / social orgs reached across race boundaries, and gave insurance, / new jobs
	- Place to get food, sing, play cards, parades. 3rd place
- *Iron Law of Wages*: supply / demand dictates wage, not worker welfare
- Employers would fire union members, higher scabs to replace striekrs, get court injunctions to stop strikes
	- Injunction used to stop Pullman Strike of 1984
- Employers (middle management) gets upset, -> violence
	- Railroad strike of 1877 -> no rail california to virgina + 100 ppl killed
- **Haymarket square protest**, (dull) untill someone threw a bomb that killed a policeman, police fired into crowd
- Americans now want to stop labor "radicalism". -> more police everywhere. 
- Linked labor unions w/ anarchism -> part of public really not like labor
	- 8 chicago anarchists convicted w/ murder w/o evidence
- Carnagie cuts wages by 20% -> AFL strikes, locks workers out of plants, (**Homestead Strike**)
	- Frick (carnagie side-kick) highers pinkerton detectives, workers fought back
- Gov of Penn finally orders peace. Anarchist (not at strike) later goes to Frick; shoots him and stabs him twice (he survived somehow) -> anarchists really not helping the labor ppl

- ppl wondered if industrialization rewards are good enough for current working conditions / violence
