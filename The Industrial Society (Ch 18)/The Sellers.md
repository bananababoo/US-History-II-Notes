Why were the new methods of advertising so important?

- Increased output not enough to sell products, marketing now exists

Buissness spending way more on marketing
Rotary Press invented (1875) can print newspaper ads way better
\
R. H. Macy, Wanamaker, Marshal Field, seperatly all invent the concept of a department store
- you can now browse big selection in one place
- Macy advertises "goods suitable for the millionaire at prices in reach of the millions"
- stuff marketing

Mail Order Catalogues (Sears, Roebuck, Montgomery Ward):
- Sold to rural places( depended on good transport and people beable to actually read)
- Eventually became big 240 page catalogue with 10k items (Montgomery Ward)

Sears (the person) does higher end mail order stuff (Watches / jewreyy)
- and then makes a big buisness called sears,
- sold everything, relied on distant consistent customers  (remember everyone is spread out now)

- Common language of no matter who you are, white black rich poor, you can always consume
- Advertizing / Chain Stores / Catalogues
- People surronded suddenly with way easier access to buy stuff, now knowing how to make want and buy stuff
- consumerism exists now
