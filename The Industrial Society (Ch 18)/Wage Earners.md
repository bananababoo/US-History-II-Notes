Who were the wage earners in the new economy?

Entrepenuers were not
- while they had some cool ideas and stuff it wasn't one or a few people

Millions of ordinary ppl:
- lots of lost stories however
- wages rose, conditions eventually got better 
- Expanding health care / education helped

## Still Life sucked
- Had to work (if skilled) about 20 cents an hour else half that
- Workers got 400-500 a year, need 600 to support family of 4

- Gov people, construction people, clerics (doctors not usefull much yet) , miners in west made money
- Coal miners / agri workers made less

- Saftey standards lower then any developed country at the time
	- Dust, Chemicals, Pollutants, rail accidents
- Working children doubled (1-5 boys had jobs at 10-15)
- Girls made less money cause they were for marrige not working
	- “We try to employ girls who are members of fam- ilies,” a box manufacturer said, “for we don’t pay the girls a living wage in this trade.”
- only 5% of women employed  (25% african amercian women worked tho, prob on farms)
- Typing / Newspaper jobs more common, women did bookkeeping or telephone operating
- Arabella became first women lawyer (but still women rights progress super slow)
	- “women had not the mentality to study law.”
- Feminized roles like teachers and doctors women did

- Gender pay super unequal

- adults > children
- Skilled > unskilled
- native > foreign
- protestant > catholic/jew
- white > black/asian

white guys got most of the reward

Blacks earned less then everyone and did mineal jobs noone wanted to do, last hired first fired

Alot of chinese people came over and then were descrimitated aginsted
people really hated chinese so gov stopped them from working in us for 10 years: **Chinese Exclusion Act**
